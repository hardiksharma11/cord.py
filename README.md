# CORD.py
CORD.py is a Python library that provides a collection of classes and methods to interact with the Cord blockchain network.

## Prerequisites for Building the SDK

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

1. **Python 3.10 or higher**:
   - CORD.py requires Python version 3.10 or higher. You can check your Python version by running:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

   - If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **pip**:
   - pip is the package installer for Python. It is usually included with Python, but you can verify its installation with:
     ```bash
     pip3 --version
     ```

   - If pip is not installed, you can install it by following these steps:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3-pip
     ```

3. **Setuptools**:
   - Setuptools is required to manage the installation of Python packages. First, check if it is already installed:
     ```bash
     pip show setuptools
     ```
   - If it is not installed, you can install it using:
     ```bash
     pip3 install setuptools
     ```


## Building the SDK

To build the SDK and see changes, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     cd <repository_directory>
     ```

2. **Install dependencies and set up modules**:
   - Use the `setup.py` script to install dependencies and set up the modules:
     ```bash
     python3 setup.py install
     ```
     

## Required Dependencies
The following dependencies are automatically installed when you run the `setup.py` script. However, if you want to install them separately, you can use the following commands:

- **substrate-interface**: A Python interface to interact with Substrate-based blockchains.
  - Installation: `pip3 install substrate-interface`
  - [Installation Guide](https://polkascan.github.io/py-substrate-interface/getting-started/installation/)

- **base58**: A Python library for Base58 encoding and decoding.
  - Installation: `pip3 install base58`
  - [Installation Guide](https://pypi.org/project/base58/)

- **mnemonic**: A Python implementation of the BIP39 mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys.
  - Installation: `pip3 install mnemonic`
  - [Installation Guide](https://pypi.org/project/mnemonic/)

- **pynacl**: A Python binding to the Networking and Cryptography (NaCl) library.
  - Installation: `pip3 install pynacl`
  - [Installation Guide](https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/)


## Experimenting with SDK Methods

After building the SDK, you can experiment with the provided methods.

### Demo Methods

The SDK includes demo methods to help you interact with the Cord blockchain network.

### Statement Method:

The `demo-statement` method allows you to interact with statement-related functionalities.

To run the statement demo, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 -u "demo/src/func_tests.py"
```

### Network Score Method:

The `network-score-tests` method demonstrates methods related to network scores.

To run the network score demo, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 -u "demo/src/network-score-tests.py"
```

## Asset Method:

The `asset-tx` method showcases methods related to assets.

To run the asset demo, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 -u "demo/src/asset-tx.py"
```

The output of each demo script will demonstrate the functionality of the corresponding method. For a detailed structure of the demo scripts, refer to the source code.
